If you want the bot to join your server, go to <https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=263671526279086092&permissions=51200&scope=bot> and confirm your server.

## Setting up Lisa yourself

After you cloned the repository, running `npm ci --prod` from your CLI should install all dependencies.
Then, add your discord API token to the environment variables as `DISCORD_TOKEN`.
After you've done that, running `npm run serve` will start the bot.
